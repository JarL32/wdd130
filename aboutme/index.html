    <h2> Jared Lehmann</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone! I live in the state of Alaska with my wife, Judith, and our 9-month old daughter. I am originally from Western New York, near the Joseph Smith sites in Palmyra. It is starting to get cold but I am excited to do some skiing and ice fishing this Winter! </p>
    <p>I enjoy skeet shooting, fishing, and reading. I cannot decide on a favorite writer, but I love old-fashioned adventure pulp like Burroughs and Howard. Lately I have been fixated on reading about Cortes and the Conquest of Mexico, so it is probably just a matter of time before I break down and buy a sword to hang on the wall.</p>
    <p> I am majoring in Business. I worked as a mortgage loan officer for a while after leaving the Army, but after seeing so many people's banking and credit information I knew that I had to finish my degree. I love the sense of community I feel at BYU-Idaho thanks to the gospel.</p>
    <p> I am very excited about taking this course. Technology is so important to our lives, and I have always felt bad about not understand it better. I look forward to learning with all of you!</p>
